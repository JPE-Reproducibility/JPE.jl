    Dear $first,
    <br>
    <br>
    I am happy to tell you that your replication package for paper $paperID is good to go for me! üöÄ
    <br>
    Here are the next steps:   
    <br>

    <ol>
    <li>the journal office will do something.</li>
    <li>you must upload your package on the JPE dataverse. Here are the instructions</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    üö® It is of great importance that you do not modify the files in your submitted package anymore. We will check the final version of the package you sent us against what you will publish on dataverse in a very strict (and automated) fashion.
    Unless the files on dataverse are <i>exactly identical</i> to ours, this check will fail.
    Please remove the letter to the data editor before you submit - and do <b>not</b> include any confidential data.
    <br>

    After these steps are completed, your files will be sent back to your editor for final acceptance.
    All this should happen before too long.
    In the meantime, if you have any queries regarding the publication process, please contact jpe@press.uchicago.edu.

    <br>
    <br>
    Thank you again for your cooperation, and congratulations on an excellent replication package.
    <br>
    <br>
    Best wishes,<br>

    Thank you for providing us with the replication
    package for your paper $paperID, titled \"$title\".
    Please find attached the report with the outcome of our checks.
    As you will see in the report, the reproducibility team has identified
    a few issues that need to be fixed.

    <ol>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2.</li>
    </ol>

    Could you please address these issues and resubmit the package like before? Please use this link:<br><br>

    $url

    <br>
    <br>

    We need you to submit the entire package again because updating
    the replication package ourselves increases the potential risk
    that the files you intend to submit for possible publication may be mishandled.

    <br>
    <br>

    Please also submit a letter addressed to me explaining how you
    dealt with each of the issues raised in the report.
    Once your package has arrived, I will return it to the reproducibility team 
    for another check.
    <br>
    <br>
    It is our policy to ask for the submission of your replication package within 30 days, i.e., by $(Dates.format(today() + Day(30), dateformat"d U Y")).

    I would like to thank you for your cooperation and I
    look forward to receiving your revised package.
