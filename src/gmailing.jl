        Go to the git repo and look at the readme, which contains step by step instructions.

        <h2>Report Submission üóíÔ∏è</h2>

        <ol>
        <li>You must edit the <code>.qmd</code> in the git repo, and compile it locally to pdf format. I recommend using the typst engine inside quarto, works much better than latex.</li>
        <li>Once you have the report compiled, committed, and pushed back to the remote, you <b>must</b> fill out this online form: https://forms.gle/u9Mp87shmZc94gzT9. <i>This will determine the amount of time (days) you spent on this, so until you submit the form, you keep wasting days</i>. Also, it is where you log your hours, so no submitted form, no money.
        </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Deadline ‚è∞</h2>

        As usual, we aim for your report to arrive within the next 10 days, i.e. by $(deadline).

    Dear $first,
    <br>
    <br>
    I am happy to tell you that your replication package for the paper titled \"$title\", with manuscript ID $paperID is good to go for me! üöÄ
    <br>
    <br>
    Here are the next steps:   
    <br>

    <ol>
    <li>You must upload your package on the JPE dataverse. The instructions for this step are <a href=https://jpedataeditor.github.io/package.html#after-the-reproducibility-checks-are-completed-publish-your-package>here.</a></li>
    <li>The JPE journal office will follow up with instructions for preparing and submitting your final manuscript files.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    üö® It is of great importance that you do not modify the files in your submitted package anymore. We will check the final version of the package you sent us against what you will publish on dataverse in a very strict (and automated) fashion.
    Unless the files on dataverse are <i>exactly identical</i> to ours, this check will fail.
    Please remove the letter to the data editor before you submit - and do <b>not</b> include any confidential data.
    <br>

    After these steps are completed, your files will be sent back to your editor for final acceptance.
    All this should happen before too long.
    In the meantime, if you have any queries regarding the publication process, please contact jpe@press.uchicago.edu.

    <br>
    <br>
    Thank you again for your cooperation, and congratulations on an excellent replication package.

    Best wishes,<br>

    Thank you for providing us with the replication
    package for your paper titled \"$title\", with manuscript ID $paperID.
    Please find attached the report with the outcome of our checks.
    As you will see in the report, the reproducibility team has identified
    a few issues that need to be fixed.

    <h3>Outline of Issues üìù</h3>


    <ol>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2.</li>
    </ol>

    Could you please address these issues and resubmit the package like before? Please use this link:<br><br>

    $url

    <br>
    <br>

    We need you to submit the entire package again because updating
    the replication package ourselves increases the potential risk
    that the files you intend to submit for possible publication may be mishandled.

    <br>
    <br>

    Please also submit a letter addressed to me explaining how you
    dealt with each of the issues raised in the report.
    Once your package has arrived, I will return it to the reproducibility team 
    for another check.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Deadline ‚è∞</h3>
    It is our policy to ask for the submission of your replication package within 30 days, i.e., by $(Dates.format(today() + Day(30), dateformat"d U Y")). Please let me know if you foresee any problems with meeting this deadline.

    I would like to thank you for your cooperation and I
    look forward to receiving your revised package.
